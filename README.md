This is a University project, where students could apply Microprocessor Based System on a real-life project. At the end of this project, my team would be able to build a GPS tracking system.



## Project Description
In this project you will develop a GPS tracking system using TM4C123G LaunchPad, the system should store the moved trajectory after power-on until a destination point is reached and calculate the taken distance.

## How We Built It
TMS is desktop application. We used PyQt5 to create an interactive GUI. PyQt5 allowed us to built a full user experience. For the backend we used python to enhance different functionality and manage database. Externally, we used a voice recognition API to enable people to interact with TMS services using voice and text.

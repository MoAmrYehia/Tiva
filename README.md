This is a University project, where students could apply Microprocessor Based System on a real-life project. At the end of this project, my team would be able to build a GPS tracking system.



## Project Description
In this project you will develop a GPS tracking system using TM4C123G LaunchPad, the system should store the moved trajectory after power-on until a destination point is reached and calculate the taken distance.

## How We Built It
The TM4C123G LaunchPad gets the longitude and the latitude from the GPS module. Then, we calculate the displacements between many points to get the distance. Finally, we display the result on the LCD module and we plot the path on an android application that is connected via a Bluetooth module.

This is a University project, where students could apply software engineering concepts on a real-life project. At the end of this project, my team would be able to submit UML diagrams, system requirements and user interface design.



## Task Monitoring System
Today, Most of the available task monitoring and management systems only offer limited features to the user. Also, they don't support multiple features for both admins and users; they do not offer smart scheduling or schedule optimizing, or even user behavior analysis which assists the user in planning their daily, weekly, or monthly tasks.

In our project we propose the development of a smart task monitoring application, which provides for the user and the admin an optimized schedule and also takes into account various constraints like appointment times, activity durations, and timing, and also pushes notifications about updates and other important features.

## How We Built It
TMS is desktop application. We used PyQt5 to create an interactive GUI. PyQt5 allowed us to built a full user experience. For the backend we used python to enhance different functionality and manage database. Externally, we used a voice recognition API to enable people to interact with TMS services using voice and text.
